# PeerPrep Frontend

This is the **frontend** for the project, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).  
It provides the user interface and communicates with the backend API to display and manage data.

---

## Overview

This frontend is structured using the **App Router** (`/app` directory) and leverages **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React hooks** for UI and state management.

The layout and navigation are defined in `app/layout.tsx`, while the main page content resides in `app/page.tsx`.
